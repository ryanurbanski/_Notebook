========================================================================
Story App
========================================================================
Description: This application would be a platform to write stories,
    from the everyday to the epic, about people and experiences
    worth remembering.

    Security and privacy would be keys as user's may choose to keep all
    of their stories private, almost as an online journal, share 
    selectively with defined user groups or publish to the 
    larger site community as a whole.

    All of the above functionality could serve as a solid MVP and
    some reach goals could include:
        - Integrating with social platforms for authentication 
            and directly posting content.
        - Photos
        - API integration with Ancestry.com or similar for keeping track 
            of stories from family tree.
        - Deploying the MVP quick enough to get real Beta users to try
            out the service and problem solve real production issues.
        - Host great audio stories and links to video's as well

Target Users:
    - Story tellers
    - people who want to become better story tellers
    - People who want to remember events with family members and friends
    - People who want a more private way to share photos
    - A platform to read, hear and see people tell great stories

eCommerce Art Store
========================================================================
Description: Right before I started this class an artist friend of mine
    was asking about the best type of site to start selling his art.  
    I planned on starting a mock up of this after we graduate but thought 
    it was worth mentioning if thats something you guys might be interested 
    in as well.



========================================================================
Beach Slushies 
========================================================================
Description: I met a man last fall who started a business selling frozen
    slushies on boardwalk areas around myrtle beach and he was looking 
    to get an app made so that people could order their drinks as they 
    walked and shopped and could pay and pick the up as they pass by.

Challenges: This was a pretty interesting use case since we'd need to 
    tie into mobile location services as well as payment processessing 
    and creating a mobile site with menu to accept orders.





========================================================================
Typong 
========================================================================
Description: This would be a gaming app where users could improve their
    code typing accuracy by creating custom drill sets of characters 
    they want to improve.

    There are lots of 'speed typing' sites that focus on writing words
    and sentences but nothing specifically for new programmers looking
    to hone their typing accuracy.

    Think 'type racer' but for more programming specific training.

    The simplest 'game' aspect I could think of was to make a pong clone.
    The ball would bounce from left to right and the user would have to type
    the correct character that appears in the prompt to unlock their paddle.

    j would move down, k => up (teaching vim movements) and keep players
    honest by having to return to the home row every time.



========================================================================
LyricShoe Box
========================================================================
Description: Whether you like his music or not, Eminem has written an 
    incredible amount of music and when describing his process said that
    he keeps all of his lyrical ideas as paper snippets in a shoebox that
    he'll pull out and combine when he needs inspiration.

    As someone that doesn't write lyrics well or consistently I thought 
    having a way to do the same digitally would be cool.

    While the initial idea is for lyrics, this could work for recording really
    any quote or phrase someone wants to tag, remember and use later. 

    The challenge would be to accept an audio snippet, convert to text (via 
    desktop or mobile app?), stored in DB and then sorted by tags that could
    be assigned to each line and moved around via mouse in the browser application.

    Writing that out sounds a little crazier than I imagined, but hey its 
    a brainstorm right??


========================================================================
Genius
========================================================================
Description: Ok so I said this half as a joke but hear me out.
    An app, right?
    It's like Tinder.
    But you and your significant other both have accounts.
    Y'all open it at the same time and swipe left or right on restaurants
        within  a radius that you determine.
    After y'all match, that's where you have dinner.
    We can call it 'Chicken Tinder'
