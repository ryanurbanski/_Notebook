Starting Phase III in the Momentum Webdesign bootcamp I realized I needed to level up my notetaking system and after considering a few options decided on using VScode with markdown files to store my notes going forward. I ultimately came accross this tutorial adding some great features to VScodeVim which I already know and love: [Suping Up VS Code as a Markdown Notebook](https://kortina.nyc/essays/suping-up-vs-code-as-a-markdown-notebook/)

I was able to setup the universal hotkey `cmd shift \` using Alfred to open this notebook directly as well as `cmd shift ;` to open the django source code since `Go To Definition` for django only takes me to the .pyi code stubs.

This first entry in this journal was also created with my first custom snippet added to my `settings.json` file and uses my default leader `\` and `d` to create autopopulate a header with today's date in the format I want : )
